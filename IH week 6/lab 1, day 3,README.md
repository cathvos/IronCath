Lab | Tableau -Geospatial

Challenge
You want to produce a map of London, UK which show the percentage of household recycling rates over the years, per borough (average recyling rate). 
This involves using Tableau, joining a spatial file (the geolocations/shape files of the London boroughs/regions) to a csv file which contains the 
recycling rates from 2013/14 to 2019/20

Your data source will be https://data.london.gov.uk/ - this is the spatial data you will need but we would like you to search the site to locate 
the quantitative data set you need for this challenge

YouÂ´ll find the results on tableau:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cath7944/viz/IHLab1day3week6/averagerecyclingrates?publish=yes

I have created a second worksheet which allows you to see the average recycling rates per area over the years to and included both into a Dashboard.
