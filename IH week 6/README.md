# lab week 6 - AB Testing

We joined the AB testing results together, (4 csv files) considering the join type and granularity of the data sources, we explored and visualised the data in Tableau. 

Baseline data quality checks: 

- how will you  show the comparative number of clients involved in the Variation Test / Control group?
- there are multiple stages to the web interaction and therefore multiple stages of the test - how can these be best visualised?
- linking together client demographic information with tests, how can we see the % of client by demographic group (for example ag) completing each test ? 

All tableau visuals your can find: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cath7944/viz/IHweek6day1/tenure?publish=yes

Execute the AB testing template in excel. The excel file with the test you can find: https://github.com/cathvos/IronCath/blob/main/IH%20week%206/ab_testing_significance_calculator.xlsx

The results are the following:

We can say the test was a success so that the proposed UI changes should be adopted. 
The conversion rate on the Variation is significantly higher.
